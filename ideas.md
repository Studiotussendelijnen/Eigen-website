## Chosen Design: Dark Cyberpunk Creative Studio

**Design Movement**: Dark Cyberpunk / Tech-Creative Noir

**Core Principles**:
- Deep dark backgrounds with high-contrast cyan/teal accents
- Bold uppercase typography creating strong visual hierarchy
- Floating geometric micro-elements as ambient decoration
- Asymmetric layouts with large watermark text in backgrounds

**Color Philosophy**:
- Background: Deep navy-black (#080c14) — creates depth and mystery
- Primary Accent: Cyan (#00e5c8) — energetic, modern, tech-forward
- Secondary Accent: Bright green (#00ff88) — used sparingly for variety
- Text: Pure white — maximum contrast against dark backgrounds
- Cards: Semi-transparent dark (#1a2035) with subtle borders

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Full-viewport hero with split content (text left, logo graphic right)
- Horizontal scrolling service cards
- Alternating left-right process timeline
- Large decorative watermark text behind content

**Signature Elements**:
- Floating geometric shapes (dots, diamonds, squares) scattered across sections
- Large barely-visible watermark text (PASSIE, PROCES) in backgrounds
- Cyan glow effects on interactive elements and accents

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Smooth scroll-based reveals
- Hover states with cyan glow
- Animated counters for stats

**Animation**:
- Fade-in-up on scroll for section content
- Floating animation for geometric decorations
- Counter animation for stats section

**Typography System**:
- Headings: Bebas Neue or similar bold condensed — uppercase, large scale
- Body: Inter or similar clean sans-serif
- Accent: Cyan color for key words in headings
